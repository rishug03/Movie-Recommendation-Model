# Movie_Recommendation_Model
This repository provides a Movie Recommendation System developed using Jupyter Notebook and Collaborative Filtering. The system recommends movies based on users' preferences and behaviors, applying collaborative filtering techniques that predict ratings for movies a user hasnâ€™t seen yet by leveraging patterns from similar users or items.

As new content is continuously generated at an exponential rate, it becomes inefficient to analyze the entire dataset of users or items when making recommendations. To improve the speed of generating recommendations, we focus on collaborative
filtering approach involving KNN(K-nearest neighbours) principle and cosine angle as a parameter to find the similarity between the users.

The dataset used in this model is MovieLens (ml-latest-small) that describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from MovieLens, a movie recommendation service. It contains 100836 ratings and 3683 tag applications across 9742 movies. These data were created by 610 users between March 29, 1996 and September 24, 2018. This dataset was generated on September 26, 2018.
